# Book Hub: Explore & Test

Book Hub is an interactive web application designed to help users explore curated books across various fields, including literature, philosophy, and science. I built this project to practice my web development skills while creating a tool that makes intellectual content more accessible and engaging.

## Key Features

* **Book Catalog:** Browse a collection of curated books with detailed summaries and insights.
* **Filtering and Search:** Easily find books by category or search for specific titles and authors.
* **Interactive Quizzes:** Test your knowledge of the content with integrated quizzes for each book.
* **Quiz History:** Tracks scores and dates using local storage for persistent data across sessions.
* **Responsive Design:** A minimal interface optimized for desktop, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Technology Stack

* **HTML5:** Semantic markup for structure and accessibility.
* **CSS3:** Modern layouts using Grid and Flexbox with a mobile-first approach.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Modular ES6 structure for state management, DOM manipulation, and data persistence using **LocalStorage**.

## Folder Structure

* `assets/` - Book covers and visual assets.
* `app.js` - Main application logic and UI rendering.
* `logic.js` - Search and filtering algorithms.
* `state.js` - Centralized app state management.
* `data.js` - Book catalog and quiz data.
* `style.css` - Custom styling and responsive design.

## Why I Created This

I wanted to make exploring books easier and more engaging for everyone. I believe that providing an extensive catalog with intuitive features is a great way to encourage reading and curiosity. Technology gives us the perfect tools to make this possible.
