		title: "Crime and Punishment",
		author: "Fyodor Dostoevsky",
		genre: ["Psychological Fiction"],
		publicationYear: 1866,
		shortDescription: "A desperate student commits murder, then grapples with intense moral and psychological turmoil.",
		description: "Raskolnikov, an impoverished former student in Saint Petersburg, develops a radical theory according to which “extraordinary” individuals are entitled to transgress moral law for the sake of a higher good. In an attempt to validate this idea and escape his misery, he commits a murder that places him at the center of a profound conflict between reason and conscience. Rather than affirming his supposed superiority, the act strips away the illusion of cold rationalism and confronts him with the moral fragility of the human condition.<br><br>Through his psychological confrontation with the investigator Porfiry Petrovich and his redemptive relationship with Sonia Marmeladova, the novel becomes a powerful meditation on guilt, suffering, and the possibility of redemption. Dostoevsky challenges the notion that pure reason can justify violence and suggests that spiritual rebirth arises not through logic, but through the acceptance of suffering and moral responsibility. Crime and Punishment ultimately stands as a critique of extreme rationalism and a profound defense of human ethics.",
